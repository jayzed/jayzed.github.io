    <p>Hey I'm Jordy.</p>
    <p>I'm a UX designer working at <a href="http://www.secondmarket.com">Secondmarket</a> in NYC.</p>
    <p> I was born and raised in Toronto, Canada. Just before living in NYC I graduated in August 2012 with a Masters degree in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
    <p>I enjoy working on the whole UX process from User Research to Prototyping and Usability Testing and am always looking to learn.</p>
