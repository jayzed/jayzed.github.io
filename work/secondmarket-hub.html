    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      While building the <a href="/work/secondmarket-checkout">checkout product</a>, we noticed that companies and funds wanted an easier way 
      more communicate to their investors to let them know how things were going. This communication includes both updates and documents.
    </p>

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>
      I have been the lead UX designer on this product from April 2013. I was involved from the very initial stages
      of product discovery to the ongoing research, prototyping, and usability testing.
      The hub is completely responsive and utilizes the bootstrap framework.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Product</h2>
    <p>
      The SecondMarket Hub is a self-serve product for companies and funds to distribute updates and documents to their investors.
      It includes a blog-style updates page for users to send updates that can be specific to a group of people, and a way
      to bulk-upload documents.

        <strong>Words Matter</strong>
        <p>
          Users want to make sure that information (especially sensitive information), is destributed to the right people.
          Having clear text helps the user feel more secure that they aren't making a mistake.
